    <h1><b> The Golden Rule By Jesus Christ</b></h1>
    <p>“All things, therefore, that you want men to do to you,
        <br>
         you also must do to them. This, in fact, is what the 
         <br>Law and the Prophets mean".
    </p>
    <h2><b>The Greatest Commands as Stated by Jesus</b></h2>
    <p>“‘You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart 
        <br>
        and with your whole soul and with your whole mind. 
        <br>
        This is the greatest and first commandment. The second,
        <br>
        like it, is this: ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.
        <br>
        On these two commandments the whole Law hangs and the 
        <br>
        Prophets.”

         <h2><b>Description of Love by Apostle Paul</b></h2>

         <p> Building on the principles stated by Jesus Christ, the 
             <br>
             apostle Paul explained what true love means.
             <br>
             In his first letter to the Christian congregation in the
             <br>
              city of Corinth, chapter 13 started with the statement
              <br>
              <i>"If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do not
             <br>
              have <strong>love</strong>, I have become a clanging gong or a clashing cymbal.
              <br>
              And if I have the gift of prophecy and understand all the 
              <br>
              sacred secrets and all knowledge,a and if I have all the
              <br>
              faith so as to move mountains, but do not have love, I am 
              <br>
              nothing. And if I give all my belongings to feed others,
              <br>
              and if I hand over my body so that I may boast, but do not 
              <br>have <b>love</b>, I do not benefit at all".</i>
              <br>
